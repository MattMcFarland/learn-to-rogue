## Learn to rogue!

super alpha version lol

Wow this is a super alpha hacked together version that is in much need of TLC, I'll be adding more info about this project in due time.

This is basically a project that outlines the start (and hopefully finish) of creating a roguelike game in JS - mainly because the algorithms
fascinate me, and I feel I'd rather learn how to make them first before using someone elses library.

I also hope to go over the code written, explain pitfalls, and help others learn this too as I go on the journey.

Feel free to have a look, but the code is in scary condition right now xD

### To use

```
git clone
npm install
node ./scratch.js
```
